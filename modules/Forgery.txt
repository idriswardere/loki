Forgery is the synonymous term for magic in Talis. There are some individuals who have the ability to open up reserves of pneuma and manipulate or bend it to their will. Those individuals are referred to as Forgers. Forgers are able to tap into pneuma reserves that are not their own and often imbue it into other things or people that lack sufficient pneuma to do certain things. It is a talent that cannot be taught, only refined. Whatever oneâ€™s capabilities are to manipulate pneuma are, they cannot improve vastly beyond what they already possess, but there are some people who are born with the ability to manipulate incredible amounts of pneuma.
