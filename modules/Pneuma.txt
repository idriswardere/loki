All organic things have energy, including mortals, beasts, and fossils. It is referred to as pneuma. The pneuma that one has is what keeps one alive, but it does not fade after someone dies. It is considered the breath of life, or the spirit. There are those in Talis who are able to access pneuma and manipulate it. They are referred to as Forgers. By manipulating pneuma, Forgers can bring inorganic objects to life, heal ailments, cause ailments, create growth, create decay, and more. Because pneuma is not rigid, the methods of manipulation are largely up to the individualâ€™s imagination.
