Dadelos is the smallest but most technologically advanced country in Talis. It is an island nation off the coast of Oer. The nation is ruled by a council of intellectuals, all of whom are not Forgers. It is incredibly crowded, and utilizes steam-powered lifts to navigate the very tall and very layered geography. Dadelos primarily uses pneuma from the Relic of Talos to create homunculi for various purposes. They not only use them themselves, but they also export to other countries, which makes up the majority of their economy. Dadelos houses one of two academies for Forgery, and it is also the entity through which the nation is governed, referred to as Schola. In Dadelos, homunculi are considered subhuman, and are created to serve mortals. Dadelos is also responsible for the majority of other technological advancements in Talis. It is considered the largest hub for learning and innovation.
