Relics are remnants of old gods that used to live in Talis before ascending to the new heavens. Relics can appear in various forms, but most commonly, they appear as landforms or fossils. Because they are remnants of old gods, relics possess an extremely high amount of energy that can be Forged by mortals. As such, large civilizations are built upon or around relics so that the energy can be harvested. Relics do not have a sustainable reserve of energy, but they typically have so much of it that it is not a concern for civilizations regardless of how much they use. When Relics run out of energy, however, it and everything it has been used to produce turns to salt.
