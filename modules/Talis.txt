Talis was the original home of the gods made by the first Forger, or the Creator. Talis was originally designed to be the heavens, with Ersos designed to be the underworld. However, when the Creator vanished, and gods began to fight over who would be the new Creator, many of them perished, and their bodies became part of the land. The winner of the war ended up being Valynor, who created Caelum. Upon its creation, she and her allies vacated Talis, while banishing her opponents to Ersos. Valynor also created mortals to inhabit Talis. The bodies of perished gods became Relics, which infused the land with energy that mortals could use to forge. Talis is now divided into seven different nations, with three hundred relics scattered throughout. People typically build cities over relics to harness the energy that is present.
