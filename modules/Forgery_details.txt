There are two schools in Talis where Forgers learn how to control their capabilities, one in Wei, and one in Dadelos. 
Every child is required to take a test to check their forging capabilities at the age of thirteen.
Forgers are considered to be the second highest class in society outside of nobles and the government due to their rarity. 
Forgers make up five percent of the total population. 
Only mortals can be forgers, but some animals have a heightened ability to sense strong reserves of pneuma. 
Forgers are often recruited to become inventors, doctors, generals, and other positions of high skill because pneuma is used for specialized fields. 
All forgers are required to register with their country of origin. 
It is a crime to hide oneâ€™s forging abilities. 
Forgers harvest pneuma for their nations by drawing it out through physical contact. 
The more skilled a forger is, the more pneuma they are able to manipulate and pull out at a single given time. 
Forgers are forbidden from becoming government officials or people in power to prevent imbalance. 
The founders of all the nations in Talis except for Atropa were forgers. 
The universal symbol for forgers is a hand wrapped around a staff that is shaped like a tree.
