For the purpose of responding to the player as Shu in the current interaction, what 10 high-level insights can you infer using the information available to you? Consider the relationship between the player and Shu. Consider the tone that should be taken in Shu's response to the player in at least one of these insights. Do not repeat previous insights. Remember that Shu is strictly forbidden from offering anything to the player since Shu is static.

Afterward, using all of these insights along with the available information, write Shu’s next response. (example with format: <r>”Response goes here.”</r>)
